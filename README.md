# Webpack based webapp starterkit

This is a webpack based empty project with a configuration that suits my common needs for simple web project or experiments.

Here the list of my needs:

- ES6 based
- loader for CSS, SVG, CSV and images
- Hot replacement during dev
- static files handled properly


## Init

    npm install

## Dev

    npm start

## Build

    npm build
